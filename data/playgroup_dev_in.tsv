This necessitates changes to the management structure in Kenya, in the reporting\nprocedures to the UK Trust, and in the frequency of meetings of the UK Trust. The charity obtained the services\nof a volunteer administrator between October and December, enabling the necessary changes in Kenya to be\nplanned and initiated.\nFor reasons of governance the trustees wrote to the Charity Commission in November 2015 and received a\nresponse in February 2016 stating that the Charity Commission had no reason not to approve the intended\nactions.\nWith more Trustees based in the South the Board held both its meetings in London (with one of those attended\nby the Executive Director of the Sanata project in Kenya). Progress in Kenya is monitored by regular Trustee\nvisits including during this year ones by the Chairman and 3 other trustees. The newly appointed Trustee had\nlived and worked in Gilgil for a year, and whose family Trust had supported the building of the new Sanata\nOrphanage (The New Restart).\nAll money raised by the UK Charity is transferred via Barclays Bank to a dedicated sterling account in the\nEquity Bank Gilgil Kenya.\nObjectives\nThe charity's objectives are:\n~\nFor the relief of sickness and the preservation of good health of young and vulnerable people and the\nwider community residing in Kenya by providing or assisting in the provision of healthcare projects\nand facilities, buildings, fixtures, fittings, medical and other equipment and of medical expertise,\nnursing, training, personnel and other resources;\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nTrustees' Annual Report\nfor the Sixteen Months Ended 31 December 2015\n~\nFor the advancement of education and vocational training by providing or assisting in the provision of\nyouth centers, rehabilitation centers, youth and community upliftment programs, vocation training\ncenters, residential homes or similar institutions and all necessary support in the interest of the social\nwelfare if such communities with a specific emphasis on the charitable needs of young and vulnerable\npeople to become self-sufficient to generate a sustainable income in the future;\n~\nAnd for other purposes which are exclusively charitable.\nActivities\nIn planning the charity's activities, the trustees have had regard to the guidance issued by the Charity\ncommission on Public Benefit.\nThe main activities in relation to these objects are the raising of funds to support the health, education and\ngeneral wellbeing of young and vulnerable people in Kenya, overseeing the operation of the Sanata Orphanage,\nand ensuring proper and accountable use of the funds raised.\nAchievements and Performance\nThe new Restart building has now been occupied for 15 months, and is proving to be an excellent resource.\nThe children are flourishing in their new home, its design has proved to be highly effective, and its location\naway from the urban area is a safer environment.\nThe new website (www restartafrlca org) is now well-established, and the improved structure of the charity\nincorporates updates on a regular basis.\nThe UK Charity's main concern has always been the Restart but its original Memorandum and Articles also\nemphasised a commitment to self-sufficiency and general uplift in the deprived community of Gilgil. Small\nbusiness enterprises such as craft and desi~, and the manufacture of briquettes (from waste paper) have been\nin existence for some time but require financial support. It is pleasing that the improved accounting and\nmanagement structure has brought them closer to breaking even. In the long term it is intended that these\ncommercial enterprises will contribute significantly to the financing of the Restart.\nIn terms of income, the Charity has had a satisfactory year but remains very conscious of the challenge of core\nfunding as the costs have increased significantly with the new building allowing the number of children looked\natter to approximately double. It has always been the Charity's avowed aim to see the Restart children through\nto a purposeful stage in their lives and this means education as well as basic care. As the children get older,\nmore are attending secondary schools, which are significantly more expensive than primary schools.\nAchievements and ambitions are considerable —one Restart boy is already at University, and by next\nSeptember 4 more will be at university, but these things cost and the Trustees have made fund -raising a key\npart of their responsibility.\nIn order to align the UK and Kenyan accounts, allowing for tighter financial control, the UK trust has changed\nits accounting period to end on 31 December from 2015 onwards.\nReserves policy\nThe charity has applied all its net income for the benefit of the Restart in Kenya, in accordance with its\nobjectives. The reserves policy is to continue to build funds for this purpose.\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nTrustees' Annual Report\nfor the Sixteen Months Ended 31 December 2015\nFinancial Review\nThe financial accounts for the sixteen months ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared and approved by\nthe Trustees.\nThe period ended 31 December 2015 has shown a substantial increase in the unrestricted funds raised.\nIncome in the year ended 31 August 2014 was higher based on specific donations for the Restart new build\nand related projects.

This necessitates changes to the management structure in Kenya, in the reporting\nprocedures to the UK Trust, and in the frequency of meetings of the UK Trust. The charity obtained the services\nof a volunteer administrator between October and December, enabling the necessary changes in Kenya to be\nplanned and initiated.\nFor reasons of governance the trustees wrote to the Charity Commission in November 2015 and received\na\nresponse in February 2016 stating that the Charity Commission had no reason not to approve the intended\nactions.\nWith more Trustees based in the South the Board held both its meetings in London (with one of those attended\nby the Executive Director of the Sanata project in Kenya). Progress in Kenya is monitored by regular Trustee\nvisits including during this year ones by the Chairman and 3 other trustees. The newly appointed Trustee had\nlived and worked in Gilgil for a year, and whose family Trust had supported the building of the new Sanata\nOrphanage (The New Restart).\nAll money raised by the UK Charity is transferred via Barclays Bank to a dedicated sterling account in the\nEquity Bank Gilgil Kenya.\nObjectives\nThe charity's objectives are:\nFor the relief of sickness and the preservation of good health of young and vulnerable people and the\nwider community residing in Kenya by providing or assisting in the provision of healthcare projects\nand facilities, buildings, fixtures, fittings, medical and other equipment and of medical expertise,\nnursing, training, personnel and other resources;\n1\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nTrustees' Annual Report\nfor the Sixteen Months Ended 31 December 2015\nFor the advancement of education and vocational training by providing or assisting in the provision of\nyouth centers, rehabilitation centers, youth and community upliftment programs, vocation training\ncenters, residential homes or similar institutions and all necessary support in the interest of the social\nwelfare if such communities with a specific emphasis on the charitable needs of young and vulnerable\npeople to become self-sufficient to generate a sustainable income in the future;\nAnd for other purposes which are exclusively charitable.\nActivities\nIn planning the charity's activities, the trustees have had regard to the guidance issued by the Charity\ncommission on Public Benefit.\nThe main activities in relation to these objects are the raising of funds to support the health, education and\ngeneral wellbeing of young and vulnerable people in Kenya, overseeing the operation of the Sanata Orphanage,\nand ensuring proper and accountable use of the funds raised.\nAchievements and Performance\nThe new Restart building has now been occupied for 15 months, and is proving to be an excellent resource.\nThe children are flourishing in their new home, its design has proved to be highly effective, and its location\naway from the urban area is a safer environment.\nThe new website (www.restartafrica.org) is now well-established, and the improved structure of the charity\nincorporates updates on a regular basis.\nThe UK Charity's main concern has always been the Restart but its original Memorandum and Articles also\nemphasised a commitment to self-sufficiency and general uplift in the deprived community of Gilgil. Small\nbusiness enterprises such as craft and design, and the manufacture of briquettes (from waste paper) have been\nin existence for some time but require financial support. It is pleasing that the improved accounting and\nmanagement structure has brought them closer to breaking even. In the long term it is intended that these\ncommercial enterprises will contribute significantly to the financing of the Restart.\nIn terms of income, the Charity has had a satisfactory year but remains very conscious of the challenge of core\nfunding as the costs have increased significantly with the new building allowing the number of children looked\nafter to approximately double. It has always been the Charity's avowed aim to see the Restart children through\nto a purposeful stage in their lives and this means education as well as basic care. As the children get older,\nmore are attending secondary schools, which are significantly more expensive than primary schools.\nAchievements and ambitions are considerable - one Restart boy is already at University, and by next\nSeptember 4 more will be at university, but these things cost and the Trustees have made fund -raising a key\npart of their responsibility.\nIn order to align the UK and Kenyan accounts, allowing for tighter financial control, the UK trust has changed\nits accounting period to end on 31 December from 2015 onwards.\nReserves policy\nThe charity has applied all its net income for the benefit of the Restart in Kenya, in accordance with its\nobjectives. The reserves policy is to continue to build funds for this purpose.\n2\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nTrustees' Annual Report\nfor the Sixteen Months Ended 31 December 2015\nFinancial Review\nThe financial accounts for the sixteen months ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared and approved by\nthe Trustees.\nThe period ended 31 December 2015 has shown a substantial increase in the unrestricted funds raised.\nIncome in the year ended 31 August 2014 was higher based on specific donations for the Restart new build\nand related projects As the operating costs of the Restart increase the trustees focus is on ensuring the\nfunding available to meet those costs.\nSources of funds include fundraising events, standing orders, single donations, either on-line or by post, and\ndonations from family charities.\nRisk Management\nThe trustees have considered the major risks to which the charity may become exposed and, following an\nexternal review by an independent firm of chartered accountants, have further reviewed those risks and are\nestablishing systems and procedures to manage these and to be able to deal with any unforeseen eventualities\nthat may occur in the future..\nThe Trustees' report has been approved by the Board of Trustees and is signed on their behalf by:\nCWboniy\nCW Conway\nChairman\nDate: 15 September 2016\n3\nIndependent Examiner's Report to The Trustees of\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nI report to you on the accounts for the sixteen months ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 4 to 9.\nRESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE TRUSTEES AND EXAMINER\nThe Trustees, who are also the Directors of the company for the purposes of company law, are responsible for\nthe preparation of the accounts.

This necessitates changes to the management structure in Kenya, in the reporting\nprocedures to the UK Trust, and in the frequency of meetings of the UK Trust. The charity obtained the services\nof a volunteer administrator between October and December, enabling the necessary changes in Kenya to be\nplanned and initiated.\nFor reasons of governance the trustees wrote to the Charity Commission in November 2015 and received a\nresponse in February 2016 stating that the Charity Commission had no reason not to approve the intended\nactions.\nWith more Trustees based in the South the Board held both its meetings in London (with one of those attended\nby the Executive Director of the Sanata project in Kenya). Progress in Kenya is monitored by regular Trustee\nvisits including during this year ones by the Chairman and 3 other trustees. The newly appointed Trustee had\nlived and worked in Gilgil for a year, and whose family Trust had supported the building of the new Sanata\nOrphanage (The New Restart).\nAll money raised by the UK Charity is transferred via Barclays Bank to a dedicated sterling account in the\nEquity Bank Gilgil Kenya.\nObjectives\nThe charity's objectives are:\n~\nFor the relief of sickness and the preservation of good health of young and vulnerable people and the\nwider community residing in Kenya by providing or assisting in the provision of healthcare projects\nand facilities, buildings, fixtures, fittings, medical and other equipment and of medical expertise,\nnursing, training, personnel and other resources;\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nTrustees' Annual Report\nfor the Sixteen Months Ended 31 December 2015\n~\nFor the advancement of education and vocational training by providing or assisting in the provision of\nyouth centers, rehabilitation centers, youth and community upliftment programs, vocation training\ncenters, residential homes or similar institutions and all necessary support in the interest of the social\nwelfare if such communities with a specific emphasis on the charitable needs of young and vulnerable\npeople to become self-sufficient to generate a sustainable income in the future;\n~\nAnd for other purposes which are exclusively charitable.\nActivities\nIn planning the charity's activities, the trustees have had regard to the guidance issued by the Charity\ncommission on Public Benefit.\nThe main activities in relation to these objects are the raising of funds to support the health, education and\ngeneral wellbeing of young and vulnerable people in Kenya, overseeing the operation of the Sanata Orphanage,\nand ensuring proper and accountable use of the funds raised.\nAchievements and Performance\nThe new Restart building has now been occupied for 15 months, and is proving to be an excellent resource.\nThe children are flourishing in their new home, its design has proved to be highly effective, and its location\naway from the urban area is a safer environment.\nThe new website (www restartafrlca org) is now well-established, and the improved structure of the charity\nincorporates updates on a regular basis.\nThe UK Charity's main concern has always been the Restart but its original Memorandum and Articles also\nemphasised a commitment to self-sufficiency and general uplift in the deprived community of Gilgil. Small\nbusiness enterprises such as craft and desi~, and the manufacture of briquettes (from waste paper) have been\nin existence for some time but require financial support. It is pleasing that the improved accounting and\nmanagement structure has brought them closer to breaking even. In the long term it is intended that these\ncommercial enterprises will contribute significantly to the financing of the Restart.\nIn terms of income, the Charity has had a satisfactory year but remains very conscious of the challenge of core\nfunding as the costs have increased significantly with the new building allowing the number of children looked\natter to approximately double. It has always been the Charity's avowed aim to see the Restart children through\nto a purposeful stage in their lives and this means education as well as basic care. As the children get older,\nmore are attending secondary schools, which are significantly more expensive than primary schools.\nAchievements and ambitions are considerable —one Restart boy is already at University, and by next\nSeptember 4 more will be at university, but these things cost and the Trustees have made fund -raising a key\npart of their responsibility.\nIn order to align the UK and Kenyan accounts, allowing for tighter financial control, the UK trust has changed\nits accounting period to end on 31 December from 2015 onwards.\nReserves policy\nThe charity has applied all its net income for the benefit of the Restart in Kenya, in accordance with its\nobjectives. The reserves policy is to continue to build funds for this purpose.\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nTrustees' Annual Report\nfor the Sixteen Months Ended 31 December 2015\nFinancial Review\nThe financial accounts for the sixteen months ended 31 December 2015 have been prepared and approved by\nthe Trustees.\nThe period ended 31 December 2015 has shown a substantial increase in the unrestricted funds raised.\nIncome in the year ended 31 August 2014 was higher based on specific donations for the Restart new build\nand related projects. As the operating costs of the Restart increase the trustees focus is on ensuring the\nfunding available to meet those costs.\nSources of funds include fundraising events, standing orders, single donations, either on-line or by post, and\ndonations from family charities.\nRisk Management\nThe trustees have considered the major risks to which the charity may become exposed and, following an\nexternal review by an independent firm of chartered accountants, have further reviewed those risks and are\nestablishing systems and procedures to manage these and to be able to deal with any unforeseen eventualities\nthat may occur in the future. .\nThe Trustees' report has been approved by the Board of Trustees and is signed on their behalf by:\nCW Conway\nChairman\nDate: 15 September 2016\nIndependent Examiner's Report to The Trustees of\nThe Sanata Charitable Trust\nI report to you on the accounts for the sixteen months ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 4 to 9,\nRESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE TRUSTEES AND EXAMINER\nThe Trustees, who are also the Directors of the company for the purposes of company law, are responsible for\nthe preparation of the accounts.

The charity’s\ntrustees consider that an audit is not required for this year under section 144(2) of the\nCharities Act 2011 (the 2011 Act) and that an independent examination is needed.\nIt is my responsibility to:\ne examine the accounts under section 145 of the 2011 Act;\no  follow the procedures laid down in the general Directions given by the Charity\nCommission under section 145(5)(b) of the 2011 Act; and\ne state whether particular matters have come to my attention.\nBasis of independent examiner's statement\nMy examination was carried out in accordance with general Directions given by the Charity\nCommission. An examination includes a review of the accounting records kept by the charity\nand a comparison of the accounts presented with those records. It also includes consideration\nof any unusual items or disclosures in the accounts, and seeking explanations from you as\ntrustees concerning any such matters. The procedures undertaken do not provide all the\nevidence that would be required in an audit, and consequently no opinion is given as to\nwhether the accounts present a “true and fair view” and the report is limited to those matters\nset out in the statement below.\nIndependent examiner's statement\nIn connection with my examination, no matter has come to my attention:\n1 which gives me reasonable cause to believe that, in any material respect, the\nrequirements:\n»  to keep accounting records in accordance with section 130 of the 2011 Act; and\ne to prepare accounts which accord with the accounting records and comply with\nthe accounting requirements of the 2011 Act\nhave not been met; or\n2 to which, in my opinion, attention should be drawn in order to enable a proper\nunderstanding of the accounts to be reached.\n \nFor and on behalfo\nCauseway House\n1 Dane Street\nBishop’s Stortford\nHertfordshire CM23 3BT\nDate: 21 )V\W‘XA N\nT S T  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial\nStatement\nof\nActivities\nDecember 31\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is Cantate Youth Choirs' Financial Statement of Activities for 2013\ntogether with the Balance Sheet and explanatory notes to support this\nStatement\n \nCantate Youth Choir\nStatement of Financial Activities 31st December 2013\n \n \n \n \n2013 2012 2011 2010 2009\nIncome\nSubs £44,472 £€47,758 £50,349 £37,360 £33,308\nGift Aid Tax Claims\nCurrent Year £9,169 £9,737 £10,311 £9,630 £8,041\nPrior Years £290 £70 £1,361 £0\nSubscriptions £53,641 £57,785 £60,730 £48,351 £41,349\nSponsorships £0 £0 £0 ©f0 £0\nDonations (inc Gift Ald) £8,315 £4,033 £15,324 £11,757 £5,000\nFundraising Events £2,134 £10,611 £13,480 £0 £0\nCapital Grants Released £853 £1,138 £1,517 £2,022 £8,125\nRevenue Grants £0 £2,350 £7,461 £1,562 £0\n£11,302 £18,131 £37,792 £15,341 £13,125\nEquipment Hire £0 £ £0 £0 £150\n* Tuck Shop £15 £385 £23 £178 £0\n100 Gross Income £1,120 £1,228 £1,468 £1,540 £1,464\nBank Interest {gross} £470 £487 £369 £200 £64\nIncome befare CD's etc and Cancerts £66,548 £78,016  £100,382 £65,610 £56,002\nCOs £115 £1,092 £1,703 £2,933 £2,855\nConcert Dress & Leisure Wear £625 £999 £850 £939 £1,152\nFriends of Cantate £654 £1,135 £1,077 £1,029 £1,614\nAlumni £0 £0 £0 £0 £931\nIncome before Concerts etc £67,942 £81,242 £104,012 £70,511 £62,554\nConcerts, Tours, Workshops £54,894 £38,981 £59,813 £41,304 £70,714\nTotal Income £122,836 £120,222 £163,825 £111,815 £133,268\n“GtateYouthchoie Page2\nFinancial Statement 31 Dec 13\nOngolng Expenses\nOffice and General Manager Salary\nMusle Team and Professional Fees\nRehearsal Roams\nVan Expenses\nMusic Costs/Hires\nInsurance\nEquipment & Maintenance\nAdvertising & Publicity\nAlumni\nPrinting, Postage, Stationery & Photocopying\nTelephone & Internet\nTravel -

The\nofficers and other committee members are elected by, and out of, the Society's members at the\nAnnual General Meeting. They hold office for one year and are eligible for re-election.\nThe members of the Cantate committee are regarded de facto as the Trustees of the charity, and the\nresponsibilities of Trustees are made clear to all committee members on election and with regard to\nbusiness conducted in committee meetings.

The procedures undertaken do not provide all the\nevidence that would be required in an audit, and consequently no opinion is given as to\nwhether the accounts present a "true and fair view" and the report is limited to those matters\nset out in the statement below.\nIndependent examiner's statement\nIn connection with my examination, no matter has come to my attention:\n1\nwhich gives me reasonable cause to believe that, in any material respect, the\nrequirements:\nto keep accounting records in accordance with section 130 of the 2011 Act; and\nto prepare accounts which accord with the accounting records and comply with\nthe accounting requirements of the 2011 Act\nhave not been met; or\n2\nto which, in my opinion, attention should be drawn in order to enable a proper\nunderstanding of the accounts to be reached.\nFor and on behalf of Price Bailey LLP\nCauseway House\n1 Dane Street\nBishop's Stortford\nHertfordshire CM23 3 3BT\nDate:\nz2\nFINAI\nCartate\nFinancial\nDecember 31\nStatement\nof\n013\nActivities\nThis is Cantate Youth Choirs' Financial Statement of Activities for 2013\ntogether with the Balance Sheet and explanatory notes to support this\nStatement\nCantate Youth Choir\nStatement of Financial Activities 31st December 2013\n2013\n2012\n2011\n2010\n2009\nIncome\nSubs\nf44,472\nf47,758\nf50,349\n137,360\nf33,308\nGift Aid Tax Clalms\nCurrent Year\nf9,169\n69,737\nE10,311\n19,630\nf8,041\nPrior Years\nE290\nf70\nf1,361\nfo\nSubscriptions\nf53,641\nf57,785\nf60,730\nf48,351\nf41,349\nSponsorships\nf0\nf0\nf0\nfo\nfo\nDonations (inc Gift Ald)\nf8,315\nf4,033\nf15,324\nf11,757\nf5,000\nFundraising Events\nf2,134\nf10,611\nf13,490\nfo\nf0\nCapital Grants Released\nf853\nf1,138\nf1,517\nf2,022\nf8,125\nRevenue Grants\nEO\nf2,350\nE7,461\nf1,562\nfo\nf11,302\nf18,131\nf37,792\nf15,341\nf13,125\nEquipment Hire\nf0\nf0\nf0\nfo\nf150\nTuck Shop\nf15\nf385\nf23\nf178\nfo\n100 Gross Income\nf1,120\nf1,228\nf1,468\nf1,540\nf1,464\nBank Interest (gross)\nf470\nf487\nf369\nE200\nE64\nIncome before CD's etc and Concerts\nf66,548\n178,016\nE100,382\nf65,610\nE56,002\nCDs\nf115\nf1,092\nf1,703\nf2,933\nf2,855\nConcert Dress & Leisure Wear\nf625\nf999\nE850\nE939\nf1,152\nFriends of Cantate\nf654\nE1,135\nE1,077\nf1,029\nf1,614\nAlumni\nf0\nE0\nfo\nfO\nE931\nIncome before Concerts etc\nf67,942\n681,242\nf104,012\nf70,511\nE62,554\nConcerts, Tours, Workshops\nf54,894\nf38,981\nE59,813\nf41,304\nf70,714\nTotal Income\nf122,836\nf120,222\nf163,825\nf111,815\nf133,268\nCantate Youth Choir\nPage 2\nFinancial Statement 31 Dec 13\n2013\n2012\n2011\n2010\n2009\nOngoing Expenses\nOffice and General Manager Salary\nf29,414\nf30,334\nE30,417\nf33,001\nf34,860\nMusic Team and Professional Fees\nf31,983\nf29,634\n628,055\nf27,949\nE32,101\nRehearsat Rooms\nf3,615\nf5,404\nf6,243\nf5,038\nf4,972\nVan Expenses\nf1,676\nf1,254\nf1,466\nf1,714\nf1,263\nMusic Costs/Hires\nf3,210\nf1,018\nf2,241\nf1,682\nf2,230\nInsurance\nf425\nf427\nf490\nf489\nE473\nEquipment & Maintenance\nf52\nE450\nf984\nf909\nf1,017\nAdvertising & Publicity\nE488\nf1,237\nf705\nf619\nE148\nAlumni\nf0\nfo\nf0\nf0\nf1,098\nPrinting, Postage Stationery & Photocopying\nf2,142\n11,647\nf583\nf1,577\nE2,385\nTelephone & Internet\nE916\nf1,058\nE811\nf1,079\nf1,642\nTravel -

Bozzi, tel 07710 996297\nCantate exists to develop and promote choral singing and other musical ability to the highest\nstandards by young people between the ages of eight and eighteen years. It currently comprises\nTraining Choir, Youth Choir and Senior Choir sections. Its main centre of operation and rehearsals is\nBishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire, and its members are drawn from the Hertfordshire,\nCambridgeshire, and Essex. It consists of up to 160 singers, drawn from a wide range of schools\nacross this region.\nConstitution: The charity is governed by the Cantate Youth Choir constitution, drawn up in February\n1994, which has the following objective:\n‘The objective of the Society shall be to promote, improve, develop and maintain public education\nand appreciation of choral music in all its aspects by the presentation of public concerts and recitals\nand by such other ways as the Society, through its Committee, shall determine from time to time.’\nThe management of the Society is in the hands of a committee consisting of an Honorary Chairman,\nHonorary Secretary and Honorary Treasurer, together with no fewer than three other members. The\nofficers and other committee members are elected by, and out of, the Society’s members at the\nAnnual General Meeting. They hold office for one year and are eligible for re-election.\nThe members of the Cantate committee are regarded de facto as the Trustees of the charity, and the\nresponsibilities of Trustees are made clear to all committee members on election and with regard to\nbusiness conducted in committee meetings. The General Manager, and one or more Music Directors\nare ex-officio members of the committee.\nTrustees/elected committee members receive no remuneration from the charity.\nA list of Trustees for 2013 is given below.\nBank: HSBC, Harlow Town Centre Branch\nIndependent Examiner: PRICE BAILEY LLP, Causeway House 1 Dane Street Bishop's Stortford CM23\n3BT\nTel 01279 755888\nSolicitors: Nockolds, Market Square, Bishop’s Stortford, CM23 3UZ. 01279 755777.\nManagement: Day to day organisation and management of Cantate is carried out by the General\nManager, who reports to the Committee via the Honorary Chairman. Terms and conditions for this\npost are set by a sub-committee of the Trustees. A job description, together with annual and longer\nterm objectives for the General Manager is set out by the Trustees. The services of the music staff,\nincluding the Music Directors, are provided on a freelance basis.\nAll other positions and responsibilities within Cantate are filled by volunteer members of the Society,\nwho are most often parents of members. These roles include office support, music librarian, choir\nmanagers, transport and staging, catering, event management, costumes, tour leaders, first aid,\npastoral care, etc.\nCantate has a policy of securing enhanced CRB checks for all volunteers and staff who come into\ncontact with members of the choirs.\nSubscription fees are charged per term to members of the choirs. The Trustees have due regard to\nmaintaining these at an affordable level, to ensure that the choirs can be as inclusive in membership\nas possible. A bursary fund is maintained for the support of members in lower-income families.\nCantate has clear regard to the public benefit of its charitable status:\ne Entry to Cantate Training Choir and Youth choir is entirely open and free of audition\nrequirements, and is limited only by the viability of choir sizes. (Membership of the Senior Choir\nrequires an adequate musical standard to have been reached.)\ne Cantate exists to develop and promote singing and musical ability in young people, and has a\nstrong educational, social and community ethos.\ne Cantate performs to a wide range of audiences, including local communities, and at national and\ninternational level.\ne Cantate performs at charitable events such as the British Legion Christmas Celebration, as well\nas at local level for hospices and other causes.\ne Cantate has participated in the Sing Up project, performing alongside school choirs in a\nmentoring and exemplar role.\ne Cantate holds Fun Sing events every year, which are open to local young people who are new to\nsinging.\ne Cantate participates with other local youth choirs and musicians in joint events where the\nexperience of its singers can benefit other groups.\ne Membership of Cantate is diverse in terms of social background and abilities.\ne Musical objectives for Cantate choirs are set by the Music Directors, working with the General\nManager and by agreement with the Trustees.\nIn January 2010 Nicholas Shaw and Graham Instrall took over the role of joint Music Directors,\nfollowing on from Michael Kibblewhite, who became Founder Music Director at the end of 1994.\nCantate Trustees from 1st January 2013 to 31st December 2013:  \nAndrew Barnes\n11 Wraglings, Beldams Lane, Bishops Stortford,\nHertfordshire, CM23 5TB\nTel: 01279 504300\nMob: 0777 5928099\nEmail: andrewpbarnes@gmail.com\nJackie Roberts (RESIGNED)\nLongmead Bardfield Road\nThaxted Essex CM6 2LR\nTel: 01371 830479\nMob: 07962065699\nEmail: ctc@cantate.co.uk\n \nSiobhan Nundram (Hon.

The charity’s\ntrustees consider that an audit is not required for this year under section 144(2) of the\nCharities Act 2011 (the 2011 Act) and that an independent examination is needed.\nIt is my responsibility to:\ne examine the accounts under section 145 of the 2011 Act;\no  follow the procedures laid down in the general Directions given by the Charity\nCommission under section 145(5)(b) of the 2011 Act; and\ne state whether particular matters have come to my attention.\nBasis of independent examiner's statement\nMy examination was carried out in accordance with general Directions given by the Charity\nCommission. An examination includes a review of the accounting records kept by the charity\nand a comparison of the accounts presented with those records. It also includes consideration\nof any unusual items or disclosures in the accounts, and seeking explanations from you as\ntrustees concerning any such matters. The procedures undertaken do not provide all the\nevidence that would be required in an audit, and consequently no opinion is given as to\nwhether the accounts present a “true and fair view” and the report is limited to those matters\nset out in the statement below.\nIndependent examiner's statement\nIn connection with my examination, no matter has come to my attention:\n1 which gives me reasonable cause to believe that, in any material respect, the\nrequirements:\n»  to keep accounting records in accordance with section 130 of the 2011 Act; and\ne to prepare accounts which accord with the accounting records and comply with\nthe accounting requirements of the 2011 Act\nhave not been met; or\n2 to which, in my opinion, attention should be drawn in order to enable a proper\nunderstanding of the accounts to be reached.\n \nFor and on behalfo\nCauseway House\n1 Dane Street\nBishop’s Stortford\nHertfordshire CM23 3BT\nDate: 21 )V\W‘XA N\nT S T  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial\nStatement\nof\nActivities\nDecember 31\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis is Cantate Youth Choirs' Financial Statement of Activities for 2013\ntogether with the Balance Sheet and explanatory notes to support this\nStatement\n \nCantate Youth Choir\nStatement of Financial Activities 31st December 2013\n \n \n \n \n2013 2012 2011 2010 2009\nIncome\nSubs £44,472 £€47,758 £50,349 £37,360 £33,308\nGift Aid Tax Claims\nCurrent Year £9,169 £9,737 £10,311 £9,630 £8,041\nPrior Years £290 £70 £1,361 £0\nSubscriptions £53,641 £57,785 £60,730 £48,351 £41,349\nSponsorships £0 £0 £0 ©f0 £0\nDonations (inc Gift Ald) £8,315 £4,033 £15,324 £11,757 £5,000\nFundraising Events £2,134 £10,611 £13,480 £0 £0\nCapital Grants Released £853 £1,138 £1,517 £2,022 £8,125\nRevenue Grants £0 £2,350 £7,461 £1,562 £0\n£11,302 £18,131 £37,792 £15,341 £13,125\nEquipment Hire £0 £ £0 £0 £150\n* Tuck Shop £15 £385 £23 £178 £0\n100 Gross Income £1,120 £1,228 £1,468 £1,540 £1,464\nBank Interest {gross} £470 £487 £369 £200 £64\nIncome befare CD's etc and Cancerts £66,548 £78,016  £100,382 £65,610 £56,002\nCOs £115 £1,092 £1,703 £2,933 £2,855\nConcert Dress & Leisure Wear £625 £999 £850 £939 £1,152\nFriends of Cantate £654 £1,135 £1,077 £1,029 £1,614\nAlumni £0 £0 £0 £0 £931\nIncome before Concerts etc £67,942 £81,242 £104,012 £70,511 £62,554\nConcerts, Tours, Workshops £54,894 £38,981 £59,813 £41,304 £70,714\nTotal Income £122,836 £120,222 £163,825 £111,815 £133,268\n“GtateYouthchoie Page2\nFinancial Statement 31 Dec 13\nOngolng Expenses\nOffice and General Manager Salary\nMusle Team and Professional Fees\nRehearsal Roams\nVan Expenses\nMusic Costs/Hires\nInsurance\nEquipment & Maintenance\nAdvertising & Publicity\nAlumni\nPrinting, Postage, Stationery & Photocopying\nTelephone & Internet\nTravel -

They consist of a Royar charter, which in turn gives authority to the Bye Laws\nof the Association and The Policy, organisation and Rules of The Scout Association.\nHow the charity is constituted: The Group is a trust established under its rules which are\ncommon to allScouts'\nTrustee selection methods: The Trustees are appointed in accordance with the Policy,\nOrganisation and Rules of The Scout Association'\nAdditional governance issues: The Group is managed by the Group Executive Committee' the\nmembers of which are the\n,charity Trustees' of the scout Group which is an educational\ncharity. As charity trustees they are responsible for complying with legislation applicable\nto charities. This includes the registration, keeping proper accounts and making returns to\nthe Charity Commission as appropriate.\nThe Committee consists of 3 independent representatives, Chair, Treasurer and Secretary\ntogether with the Group Scout Leader, parent's representation and meets 6 times a year.\nThis Group Executive Committee exists to support the Group Scout Leader in meeting the\nresponsibilities of the appointments and is responsible for:\nThe maintenance of Group property;\nThe raising of funds and the administration of Group finance; The insurance of persons,\nproperty and equipment; Group public occasions;\nAssisting in the recruitment of leaders and other adult supporU Appointing any sub\ncommittees that may be required;\nAppointing Group Administrators and Advisors other than those who are elected.\nRisk and internal control: The group has in place systems of internal controls that are designed\nto provide reasonable assurance against material mismanagement or loss, these include 2\nsignatories for all payments and comprehensive insurance policies to ensure that\ninsurable risks are covered.\nThe objectives of the group are as a unit of the Scout Association. The Aim of The Scout\nAssociation is to promote the development of young people in achieving their full physical,\nintetlectual, social and spiritual potentials, as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members\nof their tocal national and international communities. The method of achieving the Aim of the\nAssociation is by providing an enjoyable and attractive scheme of progressive training, based on\nthe Scout Promise and Law and guided by adult leadership.\nThroughout the year there have been six sections meeting on a weekly basis during term time:\nQuebec and Yukon (Beavers), Jubilee and Jungle (Cubs) and Victory and Endeavour (scouts).\nAcross allthe sections, activities were chosen and organised by leaders, with help on a week-to-\nweek basis from parent volunteers, to enable children to earn specific activity badges as well as\nto meet the criteria for the challenge badges. Activities have ranged from opportunities to\nhandle reptiles to first aid practice, from campfire cooking and whittling to races and games,\nfrom night to visiting places of worship.\nThere have been opportunities for young people in allsections to spend 'nights away', from a\nnight away in tepees for the Beaver age group, to sleepovers and camps for the Cubs and a\nvariety of camps and expeditions for the Scouts.\nPublic benefit statement: The Group meets the Charity Commission's public benefit criteria\nunder both the advancement of education and the advancement of citizenship or\ncommunity development headings.\nAfter a successful parents' quiz night to raise funds for the Group, the Cubs and Scouts had the\nopportunity to demonstrate their general knowledge at their own quiz nights which were equally\nwellenjoyed.\nOne member of Endeavour Scout troop, Rebecca, was selected to take part in a youth-led\ninternational camp in Switzerland. The Scouts took part in a sponsored hike to raise money for\nRebecca and raised more than was needed so were able to buy more camping equipment with\nthe extra money.\nThe Summer barbecue and AGM was again popular and was the main fundraising event of the\nyear, raising just over f 1.200.\nFour young leaders attached to the group completed their Duke of Edinburgh Award - one\ngained bronze and three gained silver awards.\nThe Group applied for and received a f3000 grant from Wooburn Parish council. This was used\nto buy and install security lights for the outside of the building to complement the new security\nsystem and also to buy additional equipment for the Group Camp.\nWe held a Group Camp at Paccar in June - the first for many years. Over 100 children and young\npeople from the Group took part, with Beavers visiting for the day and Cubs, Scouts and Young\nLeaders camping for two nights. The money from the grant paid for enough tents for all the\nyoung people to sleep in!\nThirty six children in the Group received their Chief Scout awards during the year.\nSeveral teams of Scouts entered the County Orienteering competition, the Big '0', held in\nWendover Woods in October 2015. One of the Bourne End teams came second.\nReserves Policy: The Group's poliry on reserves is to hold sufficient resources to continue the\ncharitable activities of the group should income and fundraising activities fall short. The\nGroup Executive Committee considers that the group should hold a sum equivalent to\nf4500 to ensure that there will be enough money to cover any emergency repairs and\nreplacements e.g. to the heating in the Scout Hut.\nThe Group held reserves of approximately f,L?7OO against this at year end. This is above\nthe level required for operating expenses. However this can be explained by a substantial\nsum of money that was bequeathed to the Scout Group a few years ago by a local\nresident to ensure the continuation of Scouting in Bourne End.\nlnvestment policy: The Group does not have sufficient funds to invest in longer term\ninvestments. The Group has therefore adopted a risk averse strategy to the investment of\nits funds. Allfunds are held in cash using only mainstream banks or building societies.\nThe Group would like to become more involved with the localcommunity and make a bigger\nimpact on Bourne End Night.\nIt remains a priority to increase the number of leaders for Jubilee Cub pack as there are currently\nonly 2 leaders on a Wednesday evening. We would also like to increase the number of young\nleaders assisting in all sections and increase the quality of their training.\nWe have moved forward with the idea of a group website and one of our leaders has begun work\non it. We hope to launch it soon.\nThe construction of a World War One trench will be repeated in the back room of the Scout Hut\nin November, following the success of the previous trench exhibition in 20L4.\nThe Group will be supporting one of the Explorer Scouts, Jack, in his fundraising for a trip to\nEcuador run through a youth scheme at his school.\nThe trustees declare that they have approved the trustees' report above.\nSigned on behalf of the charity's trustees\nSignature(s)\nFull name(s)\nPosition\nDate\nAlisa Schroeder\nEmma Lee\nTreasurer\nTrustee {Group Scout Leader}\n2\n5\n0\nI1,\n7\nlndependent examiner's\naccounts\nreport on the\nReport ta the truehesl\nmembers af\nOn accounts for tlm year\nended\nSet out on peges\nRespective re$pensibitities of\ntrustees and examlner\nBasls of independent\nexaminer's statement\nlndependent examinefs\nstaternent\n1* Bourne End Smut Graup\n31*t March 2il16\nCharity no g 300703\n1-3\nThe charitfs trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts.

A personal bank statement was seen as proof of purchase for f407.94\nof\nexpenditure but receipts were mislaid for a further f228.06 of expenditure. A letter confirming this has been signed by the trustees and included in the Accounts folder.\nb\nExpenditure on HQ maintenance was higher than the previous year and included installation of a security system and cameras, for which we received a grant, as well as\nthe ongoing Broadband costs for monitoring the system. Work was carried out on shelving in the garage to enable equipment to be stored securely. Two annual rent\npayments were also made within the same financial year one in Apri 2015 for the year 2015/16, and one in March 2016 for the year 2016/17. General running costs\nsuch as cleaning, electircity and oil costs also increased with the creation of another Scout section and therefore increased use of the hall.\nC The period of of cover of the insurance policy was extended by 4 months SO the policy was not due for renewal in the 2015-16 financial year. The cost has been included\nas a liability at the year end.\nd\nGroup expenses were higher than the previous year as the Group spent f1047 on T-shirts featuring the 1st Bourne End logo for leaders and for children joining the\ngroup, to be worn while undertaking activities and camps, as well as fleeces for the leaders. A small number of children's fleeces were ordered for resale.

They consist of a Royal Charter, which in turn gives authority to the Bye Laws\nof the Association and The Policy, Organisation and Rules of The Scout Association.\nHow the charity is constituted: The Group is a trust established under its rules which are\ncommon to all Scouts.\nTrustee selection methods: The Trustees are appointed in accordance with the Policy,\nOrganisation and Rules of The Scout Association.\nAdditional governance issues: The Group is managed by the Group Executive Committee, the\nmembers of which are the 'Charity Trustees' of the Scout Group which is an educational\ncharity. As charity trustees they are responsible for complying with legislation applicable\nto charities. This includes the registration, keeping proper accounts and making returns to\nthe Charity Commission as appropriate.\nThe Committee consists of 3 independent representatives, Chair, Treasurer and Secretary\ntogether with the Group Scout Leader, parent's representation and meets 6 times a year.\nThis Group Executive Committee exists to support the Group Scout Leader in meeting the\nresponsibilities of the appointments and is responsible for:\nThe maintenance of Group property;\nThe raising of funds and the administration of Group finance; The insurance of persons,\nproperty and equipment; Group public occasions;\nAssisting in the recruitment of leaders and other adult support; Appointing any sub\ncommittees that may be required;\nAppointing Group Administrators and Advisors other than those who are elected.\nRisk and internal control: The group has in place systems of internal controls that are designed\nto provide reasonable assurance against material mismanagement or loss, these include 2\nsignatories for all payments and comprehensive insurance policies to ensure that\ninsurable risks are covered.\nSection C\nObjectives and activities\nThe objectives of the group are as a unit of the Scout Association. The Aim of The Scout\nAssociation is to promote the development of young people in achieving their full physical,\nintellectual, social and spiritual potentials, as individuals, as responsible citizens and as members\nof their local national and international communities. The method of achieving the Aim of the\nAssociation is by providing an enjoyable and attractive scheme of progressive training, based on\nthe Scout Promise and Law and guided by adult leadership.\nThroughout the year there have been six sections meeting on a weekly basis during term time:\nQuebec and Yukon (Beavers), Jubilee and Jungle (Cubs) and Victory and Endeavour (Scouts).\nAcross all the sections, activities were chosen and organised by leaders, with help on a week-to-\nweek basis from parent volunteers, to enable children to earn specific activity badges as well as\nto meet the criteria for the challenge badges. Activities have ranged from opportunities to\nhandle reptiles to first aid practice, from campfire cooking and whittling to races and games,\nfrom night to visiting places of worship.\nThere have been opportunities for young people in all sections to spend 'nights away', from a\nnight away in tepees for the Beaver age group, to sleepovers and camps for the Cubs and a\nvariety of camps and expeditions for the Scouts.\nPublic benefit statement: The Group meets the Charity Commission's public benefit criteria\nunder both the advancement of education and the advancement of citizenship or\ncommunity development headings.\nSection D\nAchievements and performance\nAfter a successful parents' quiz night to raise funds for the Group, the Cubs and Scouts had the\nopportunity to demonstrate their general knowledge at their own quiz nights which were equally\nwell enjoyed.\nOne member of Endeavour Scout troop, Rebecca, was selected to take part in a youth-led\ninternational camp in Switzerland. The Scouts took part in a sponsored hike to raise money for\nRebecca and raised more than was needed SO were able to buy more camping equipment with\nthe extra money.\nThe Summer barbecue and AGM was again popular and was the main fundraising event of the\nyear, raising just over f1200.\nFour young leaders attached to the group completed their Duke of Edinburgh Award -en one\ngained bronze and three gained silver awards.\nThe Group applied for and received a f3000 grant from Wooburn Parish council. This was used\nto buy and install security lights for the outside of the building to complement the new security\nsystem and also to buy additional equipment for the Group Camp.\nWe held a Group Camp at Paccar in June - the first for many years. Over 100 children and young\npeople from the Group took part, with Beavers visiting for the day and Cubs, Scouts and Young\nLeaders camping for two nights. The money from the grant paid for enough tents for all the\nyoung people to sleep in!\nThirty six children in the Group received their Chief Scout awards during the year.\nSeveral teams of Scouts entered the County Orienteering competition, the Big 'O', held in\nWendover Woods in October 2015. One of the Bourne End teams came second.\nSection E\nFinancial Review\nReserves Policy: The Group's policy on reserves is to hold sufficient resources to continue the\ncharitable activities of the group should income and fundraising activities fall short. The\nGroup Executive Committee considers that the group should hold a sum equivalent to\nf4500 to ensure that there will be enough money to cover any emergency repairs and\nreplacements e.g. to the heating in the Scout Hut.\nThe Group held reserves of approximately f12700 against this at year end. This is above\nthe level required for operating expenses. However this can be explained by a substantial\nsum of money that was bequeathed to the Scout Group a few years ago by a local\nresident to ensure the continuation of Scouting in Bourne End.\nInvestment policy: The Group does not have sufficient funds to invest in longer term\ninvestments. The Group has therefore adopted a risk averse strategy to the investment of\nits funds. All funds are held in cash using only mainstream banks or building societies.\nSection F\nOther optional information\nThe Group would like to become more involved with the local community and make a bigger\nimpact on Bourne End Night.\nIt remains a priority to increase the number of leaders for Jubilee Cub pack as there are currently\nonly 2 leaders on a Wednesday evening. We would also like to increase the number of young\nleaders assisting in all sections and increase the quality of their training.\nWe have moved forward with the idea of a group website and one of our leaders has begun work\non it. We hope to launch it soon.\nThe construction of a World War One trench will be repeated in the back room of the Scout Hut\nin November, following the success of the previous trench exhibition in 2014.\nThe Group will be supporting one of the Explorer Scouts, Jack, in his fundraising for a trip to\nEcuador run through a youth scheme at his school.\nSection G\nDeclaration\nThe trustees declare that they have approved the trustees' report above.\nSigned on behalf of the charity's trustees\nSignature(s)\ndfliweder\nFull name(s)\nAlisa Schroeder\nEmma Lee\nPosition\nTreasurer\nTrustee (Group Scout Leader)\nDate\n2\n5\n0\n1\n1\n7\nIndependent examiner's report on the\naccounts\nSection A\nIndependent Examiner's Report\nReport to the trustees/\n1st Bourne End Scout Group\nmembers of\nOn accounts for the year\n31s March 2016\nCharity no\n300703\nended\nSet out on pages\n1-3\nRespective responsibilities of\nThe charity's trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts.

The method of achieving the Aim of the\nAssociation is by providing an enjoyable and attractive scheme of progressive training, based on\nthe Scout Promise and Law and guided by adult leadership.\nThroughout the year there have been six sections meeting on a weekly basis during term time:\nQuebec and Yukon (Beavers), Jubilee and Jungle (Cubs) and Victory and Endeavour (scouts).\nAcross allthe sections, activities were chosen and organised by leaders, with help on a week-to-\nweek basis from parent volunteers, to enable children to earn specific activity badges as well as\nto meet the criteria for the challenge badges. Activities have ranged from opportunities to\nhandle reptiles to first aid practice, from campfire cooking and whittling to races and games,\nfrom night to visiting places of worship.\nThere have been opportunities for young people in allsections to spend 'nights away', from a\nnight away in tepees for the Beaver age group, to sleepovers and camps for the Cubs and a\nvariety of camps and expeditions for the Scouts.\nPublic benefit statement: The Group meets the Charity Commission's public benefit criteria\nunder both the advancement of education and the advancement of citizenship or\ncommunity development headings.\nAfter a successful parents' quiz night to raise funds for the Group, the Cubs and Scouts had the\nopportunity to demonstrate their general knowledge at their own quiz nights which were equally\nwellenjoyed.\nOne member of Endeavour Scout troop, Rebecca, was selected to take part in a youth-led\ninternational camp in Switzerland. The Scouts took part in a sponsored hike to raise money for\nRebecca and raised more than was needed so were able to buy more camping equipment with\nthe extra money.\nThe Summer barbecue and AGM was again popular and was the main fundraising event of the\nyear, raising just over f 1.200.\nFour young leaders attached to the group completed their Duke of Edinburgh Award - one\ngained bronze and three gained silver awards.\nThe Group applied for and received a f3000 grant from Wooburn Parish council. This was used\nto buy and install security lights for the outside of the building to complement the new security\nsystem and also to buy additional equipment for the Group Camp.\nWe held a Group Camp at Paccar in June - the first for many years. Over 100 children and young\npeople from the Group took part, with Beavers visiting for the day and Cubs, Scouts and Young\nLeaders camping for two nights. The money from the grant paid for enough tents for all the\nyoung people to sleep in!\nThirty six children in the Group received their Chief Scout awards during the year.\nSeveral teams of Scouts entered the County Orienteering competition, the Big '0', held in\nWendover Woods in October 2015. One of the Bourne End teams came second.\nReserves Policy: The Group's poliry on reserves is to hold sufficient resources to continue the\ncharitable activities of the group should income and fundraising activities fall short. The\nGroup Executive Committee considers that the group should hold a sum equivalent to\nf4500 to ensure that there will be enough money to cover any emergency repairs and\nreplacements e.g. to the heating in the Scout Hut.\nThe Group held reserves of approximately f,L?7OO against this at year end. This is above\nthe level required for operating expenses. However this can be explained by a substantial\nsum of money that was bequeathed to the Scout Group a few years ago by a local\nresident to ensure the continuation of Scouting in Bourne End.\nlnvestment policy: The Group does not have sufficient funds to invest in longer term\ninvestments. The Group has therefore adopted a risk averse strategy to the investment of\nits funds. Allfunds are held in cash using only mainstream banks or building societies.\nThe Group would like to become more involved with the localcommunity and make a bigger\nimpact on Bourne End Night.\nIt remains a priority to increase the number of leaders for Jubilee Cub pack as there are currently\nonly 2 leaders on a Wednesday evening. We would also like to increase the number of young\nleaders assisting in all sections and increase the quality of their training.\nWe have moved forward with the idea of a group website and one of our leaders has begun work\non it. We hope to launch it soon.\nThe construction of a World War One trench will be repeated in the back room of the Scout Hut\nin November, following the success of the previous trench exhibition in 20L4.\nThe Group will be supporting one of the Explorer Scouts, Jack, in his fundraising for a trip to\nEcuador run through a youth scheme at his school.\nThe trustees declare that they have approved the trustees' report above.\nSigned on behalf of the charity's trustees\nSignature(s)\nFull name(s)\nPosition\nDate\nAlisa Schroeder\nEmma Lee\nTreasurer\nTrustee {Group Scout Leader}\n2\n5\n0\nI1,\n7\nlndependent examiner's\naccounts\nreport on the\nReport ta the truehesl\nmembers af\nOn accounts for tlm year\nended\nSet out on peges\nRespective re$pensibitities of\ntrustees and examlner\nBasls of independent\nexaminer's statement\nlndependent examinefs\nstaternent\n1* Bourne End Smut Graup\n31*t March 2il16\nCharity no g 300703\n1-3\nThe charitfs trustees are responsible for the preparation of the accounts.

At present the charity provides\nbursaries and facilities for older students continuing their rabbinical research and grants for\nthe advancement of education, religion, relief of poverty and the needy. The charity's facilities\nare used for educational advice. Additionally an educational holiday is usually organised for\nfamilies from deprived inner city areas in a relaxing atmosphere with fresh countryside air.\nGrants of E2,615 (2016 - f10,050) were made during the year. The results are as shown on the\naccounts.\nThe directors/trustees who served during the year were Rabbi Y M Pinter and Mrs P Lowin.\nAll board decisions are unanimous. The board has the power to appoint new trustees.\nIn the opinion of the directors/trustees, the funds of the charity are sufficient for its purposes.\nThe charity has policy of trying to ensure that it has liquid funds equal to at least four weeks'\nprojected bursary payments. The reserves of f29, 828 (2016 - 85, 144) reflect this.\nThe charity only makes grants to other charities and individuals if it receives specific funds to\ndo so.\nThe major risks to which the charity is exposed, as identified by the trustees, have been\nreviewed and systems have been established to mitigate those risks. The trustees have\ncomplied with the duty in the Charities Act 2011 to have due regard to guidance published by\nthe Charity Commission, including public benefit guidance.\nThe directors/trustees would like to thank the charitable organisations, corporate sponsors and\nothers who have ably assisted the charity with their funds and/or their time.\nThis report which includes the information on page 1 and note 4 has been prepared in\naccordance with the special provisions for small companies under Part 15 of the Companies\nAct 2006.\n2017\nP 1.08'IN - DIRECTOR/TRUSTEE\nBY ORDER OF THE BOARD\nBEER SHIVHJEL LIMITED\nSTATEMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS/TRUSTEES\nYEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2017\nCompany law requires the directors/trustees to prepare financial statements (including a\nreport) for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the\ncompany at the end of the year and of the result for the year then ended in accordance with\napplicable law and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice and observe the\nmethods and principles of the Charity SORP and they must not approve the accounts unless\nthey are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the company's state of affairs and its\nresults.\nIn preparing those financial statements, the directors/trustees are required to:\nselect suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\nThe director/trustees are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records, which\ndisclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the charity and\nenable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act\n2006, the Charities Act 2011, and the Charity (Accounts and Reports) Regulations\n2008. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the charity and hence\nfor taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other\nirregularities.\nmake judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\nprepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to\npresume that the charity will continue in business.\nBEER SHMUEL LIMITED\nINDEPENDENT EXAMINERS' REPORT TO THE MEMBERS\nYEAR ENDED 31 JANUARY 2017\nI report on the unaudited accounts for the year ended 31 January 2017 set out on pages 6 to 11\nwhich I have prepared on behalf of the charitable company under the historical cost\nconvention and in compliance with applicable accounts standards, including SORP 2015 (FRS\n102).\nRESPECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS/TRUSTEES AND THE\nEXAMINERS\nThe directors/trustees of the company are responsible for the preparation of the accounts. The\ndirectors/trustees consider that an audit is not required for this year under section 144(2) of the\nCharities Act 2011 (the 2011 Act) and part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and that an\nindependent examination is needed. The charity's gross income exceeded 6250, 000 and I am\nqualified to undertake the examination by being a qualified member of the Association of\nChartered Certified Accountants.\nHaving been satisfied that the charity is not subject to audit under company law and is eligible\nfor independent examination it is my responsibility to:\n~\nexamine the accounts under section 145 of the 2011 Act;\n~\nto follow the procedures laid down in the General Directions given by the Charity\nCommission under section 145 (5) (b) of the 2011 Act; and\n~\nto state whether particular matters have come to my attention.\nBASIS OF INDEPENDENT EXAMINERS' REPORT\nMy examination was carried out in accordance with the General Directions yven by the\nCharity Commission.
